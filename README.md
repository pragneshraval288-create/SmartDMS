# SmartDMS Enterprise

High-level Document Management System for learning / internship demo.

## Features Implemented

- User authentication (Admin, Manager, Employee)
- Role-based access control
- Secure document upload with multiple file types
- Document metadata (title, description, tags, category, version, type, uploader, timestamps)
- Versioning with history
- Advanced search, filters and sorting
- Document preview (PDF/image)
- Soft delete / archive + recycle bin
- Activity log / audit trail
- Dashboard with stats & simple charts
- Document sharing with other users (+ expiry)
- Comments on documents
- Basic notification center (in-app)
- Bulk upload
- Simple API endpoints (JSON) for documents
- Workflow states (Pending / Approved / Rejected)
- Expiry date for documents

Some advanced enterprise items (cloud storage, MFA, backup automation, encryption) are included in a simplified, demo-friendly way in the code and structure so you can explain the architecture.

## How to run

1. Create virtualenv (optional)

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows
# or
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux / macOS
```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set FLASK_APP and run

```bash
cd backend
set FLASK_APP=app.py      # on Windows CMD
# or PowerShell:  $env:FLASK_APP="app.py"
flask run
```

App will be available at http://127.0.0.1:5000

Default:
- You must register first.
- To make a user admin or manager, open `instance/smartdms_enterprise.db` in a SQLite editor and change `role` column to `admin` or `manager`.

## Project Overview  
SmartDMS is an academic-grade document management system focused on:  
- Secure user authentication (password hashing, session management)  
- Role-based access control (Admin vs. User)  
- Folder-based hierarchy and document organization  
- Document versioning, soft-delete, archiving, and restoration  
- Activity logging and in-app notifications for auditing  

Its clean architecture separates models, services, routes, and templates, making it modular and easy to extend.
